DN 1.51 is downloaded from the official vendor:
https://www.ritlabs.com/download/dn/dn151.zip

To verify:
1) Download the ZIP manually and compute hash:
   - PowerShell: Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 dn151.zip
2) Put the value as 'sha256:...' in chocolateyinstall.ps1 ($checksum).

The launcher batch only calls locally installed DOSBox-X and the DN.COM
extracted to tools\dn151. No system changes are made beyond Chocolatey files.
